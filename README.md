In this app, I created the basic user registration and log-in module using Volley library and JSON. 
Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster. Volley is available on GitHub. Volley offers the following benefits: Automatic scheduling of network requests. ... Transparent disk and memory response caching with standard HTTP cache coherence.

The advantages of using the Volley library are as follows:

Easier and faster request management.
Provide efficient network management.

For the server-side data handling, we are using the PHP with XAMPP server and MySQL for data manipulation.
Before creating the Android application module,You first create the server-side data handling API code for registration and log-in in PHP and MySQL.
The link of PHP code is given below.

Now,Open Android studio and make app using Volley library and JSON.
In this Android application, we will create the three activity class for user registration, user log-in and display the user detail in main activity (as a profile).
